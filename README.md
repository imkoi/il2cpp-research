# Unity IL2CPP Research
Hello everyone! In this document I would show some difference with .net code and unity il2cpp code.
Here I will not describe how il2cpp works, but will show some interesting places that I found.

Topics:
* [Objects and allocations](ObjectAllocation.md)
* [Types and Virtual Machine](TypesAndVM.md)
* [Method calls, Inlined and Not inlined](Inlines.md)
* [Fields and properties](FieldAndProperties.md)

If you would see more topics - please give me the feedback :)
